# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Amazon-Fine-Food-Reviews

Here we are doing analysis of amazon food reviews using python , ML and NLTK.


# Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be downloaded from Kaggle. It contains approximately 568,454 food reviews collected from Amazon.

# Code
The code is written in Python 3 and can be found in the code directory. The main script for sentiment analysis is sentiment_analysis.py. This script reads the dataset and performs sentiment analysis using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library.

# Results
The results of sentiment analysis are stored in the results directory. The sentiment_analysis_results.csv file contains the sentiment analysis results for each review in the dataset. The file contains the review text, sentiment score, and sentiment category (positive, negative, or neutral).

# Usage
